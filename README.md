## About Me
Welcome to my Jupyter Exploration repository! This repository is dedicated to my work and experiments in the **Computer Vision** field, as part of my coursework in the Computer Vision class. Here, you’ll find various notebooks that document my journey through key concepts, algorithms, and projects related to computer vision, from basic image processing to more advanced machine learning techniques.

The goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding computer vision algorithms and their real-world applications. I will be experimenting with various libraries and frameworks such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more. You’ll also see detailed explanations and visualizations that aim to make complex concepts more digestible and accessible.

Feel free to explore the notebooks, run them, and provide feedback. I look forward to learning, experimenting, and growing in the exciting field of computer vision!
